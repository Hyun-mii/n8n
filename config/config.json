I need to see the actual content to help you modify the JSON file. However, based on your template, it appears you're trying to:

1. Get data from a GitHub item
2. Apply modifications based on a request from a Notion database page

Since the template variables aren't populated, I'll provide the format for how I would respond:

```json
{
  "modified": true,
  "data": {}
}
```

To properly help you, please provide:
1. The actual content from `{{ $('GitHub').item.json.data }}`
2. The modification request from `{{ $('Get many database pages').item.json.properties.['수정 요청'].rich_text[0].plain_text }}`

Once you provide these values, I'll output the modified JSON object according to your specifications.
