I need to see the actual content of the current file and the modification request to provide you with the correct JSON output. However, since the template variables `{{ $('GitHub').item.json.data }}` and `{{ $('Get many database pages').item.json.properties.['수정 요청'].rich_text[0].plain_text }}` are not resolved, I cannot provide the specific modified JSON.

Please provide:
1. The current JSON file content
2. The modification request

Then I'll output the modified JSON object according to your requirements.
