I need to see the actual content of the current file and the modification request to provide you with the updated JSON. The variables you've referenced ({{ $('GitHub').item.json.data }} and {{ $('Get many database pages').item.json.properties.['수정 요청'].rich_text[0].plain_text }}) appear to be placeholders from a workflow tool like n8n.

Could you please provide:
1. The actual current JSON file content
2. The specific modification request

Once you provide these, I'll output the modified JSON object according to your requirements.
